### Tasks

``Mandatory`` 

| Task | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0. This is one of these | Write a method that returns True if the object is an int, otherwise return False |
| 1. For instance | Write a method that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, Array, otherwise return False |
| 2. Only subclass | Write a method that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherits from the specified class, otherwise return False. The object must be a subclass; your method cannot return True if the object is an instance of the base class |
| 3. Type | Write a method that prints the names of the available properties and methods of an object. See example for output format. |
| 4. It's not a lesson in classes and inheritance without a Dog | Write a empty class Dog that inherits from empty class Animal |
| 5. Basic shapes | Write a class Shape |
| 6. Rectangle | Based on 5-shape, write a class Rectangle that inherits from Shape |
| 7. Full rectangle | Based on 6-shape, write a class Rectangle that inherits from Shape |
| 8. Square #1 | Based on 7-shape, write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle |
| 9. Square #2 | Based on 8-shape, write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle |
| 10. Liskov | Write a blog post that explains the problem with implementing a Square class as a derived class of Rectangle. It should cover: what Liskovâ€™s substitution principle is, why Square inheriting from Rectangle is not an ideal design choice, ways that this class hierarchy could be improved |
