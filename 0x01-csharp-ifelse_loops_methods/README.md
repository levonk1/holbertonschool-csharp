This is a project from Holberton School.

### Tasks

``Mandatory``

| Task | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing | This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative. |
| 1. The last digit | This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative. |
| 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game | Write a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. |
| 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off | Write a program that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e. You can only use Console.Write once. You can only use one loop in your code |
| 4. Hexadecimal printing  | Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example) |
| 5. 00...99 | Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99. |
| 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need | Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits. |
| 7. islower | Write a method that checks for lowercase character. |
| 8. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; its what we do with them that's important | Write a method that prints the last digit of a number. |
| 9. a + b | Write a method that adds two integers and returns the result. |
| 10. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line | Write a method that draws a straight line in the terminal. |
| 11. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe | Write a method that draws a diagonal line in the terminal. Class Name: class Line. Prototype: public static void PrintDiagonal(int length). Where length is the number of times the character \ should be printed. The line should end with a new line. If length is 0 or less, the function should only print a new line |
| 12. Fizz Buzz | Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz. Each element should be followed by a space. The last element should be followed by a new line |
